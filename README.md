# Music Generation using Deep Learning 🎵

## Overview
This is my first Deep Learning project, focused on generating music using neural networks.  
The project was built as part of the *MIT Deep Learning* course and represents my first hands-on experience applying deep learning concepts to a real creative task.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model to learn musical patterns from existing data and generate new music sequences.  
Through this project, I explored how neural networks can model sequential data and create meaningful outputs.

## What I Learned
- How deep learning models can learn complex patterns such as music  
- Working with sequential data  
- Training models and improving results through experimentation  
- Gaining patience and practical experience in my first Deep Learning project  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Deep Learning  
- Neural Networks  
- MIT Deep Learning Course Materials  

## Project Status
✅ Completed  
This project is a learning milestone, and future improvements may include experimenting with different models or datasets.

## Acknowledgments
- MIT Deep Learning Course  
- All open-source resources that made this learning experience possible

## Notes
This repository represents my *first step* into Deep Learning.  
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome 🙂
